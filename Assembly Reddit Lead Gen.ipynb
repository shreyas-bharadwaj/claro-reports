      "My \"luxuxy condo\" in CA ran tests on plumbing and shut off water to the entire building 2 weeks ago.  After water turned back on, multiple units (I was told around 30 out of 150 units) developed \"water temperature balance issues\", some getting only warm/hot water and some only getting cold/cool water.\n",

      "HOA sent their plumbers multiple times to the building and some? of the affected units.  From limited info I was told by management, at least one \"bad sensor\" was replaced in the main water control module of the building.  Some affected units may have had plumbers adjust something in their shower knob/control.\n",

      "After 2 weeks, apparently all other units have their cold hot water balance restored, except for my unit,  which is the bottom unit on this \"stack.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2 weeks, my unit is not getting cold water despite 3 visits by the HOA plumber.  Each time, different plumbers from the same company came and did not seem to have concrete diagnosis or plan.  For most of past 2 weeks, my unit produced warm to hot water at coldest setting no matter how long we ran the water.  They made a couple of \"adjustments\" to the building's water unit and claimed it will take 24-48 hours after each adjustment to take affect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, when I turn on my water on coldest setting, I have to run the water for about 30 minutes before warm water turns to lukewarm/coolish.  If I come back in half an hour after turning off water, I have to go through same drill with running the water for 20-30 min in order to avoid the warm water.\n",
